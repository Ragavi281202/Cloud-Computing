        <h1 style="color: black; text-align: center;"><b><em>What is Cloud Computing</em></b></h1>
        <p style="color: rgb(10, 1, 19);font-size: 30px;text-align: left;"><em>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.Cloud computing is commonly known as delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases,  and intelligence over the Internet.The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.</em></p>
        <h1 style="color: black; text-align: center;"><b><em>Cloud Computing – Nomenclature</em></b></h1>
        <img src="img cc1.jpg" width="510px" height="310px" style="float: right;">
        <p style="color: rgb(5, 63, 3); font-size: 30px; text-align:left ;"><em>From the days when use of internet started becoming popular, the network architecture diagrams show internet as cloud to hide the complexities from the end-user – hence the name cloud computing. The applications/ software are provided as services which reside in data centers with server farms and redundant storage. End-users can access them via web browsers in laptops or hand-held devices. Google Apps, Facebook and salesforce.com are examples of cloud computing which are becoming very popular especially with the younger generations.</em></p>
        <h1 style="color:black; text-align: center;"><b><em>History</em></b></h1>
        <p style="color: crimson; font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Cloud computing was popularized with Amazon.com releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006.

            References to the phrase "cloud computing" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document.
            
            The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET by as early as 1977, and the CSNET by 1981—both predecessors to the Internet itself. The word cloud was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the endpoints of a network are connected are not relevant to understanding the diagram.
            
            The term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993, when Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&T used it in describing their (paired) Telescript and PersonaLink technologies.</em></p>

        <h1 style="color:black; text-align: center;"><b><em>Benefits of Cloud Computing</em></b></h1>
        <p style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Cloud Computing is a totally different paradigm of personal as well as corporate computing which drifts away from the traditional software business model. There are several positive factors for deciding in favor of moving to cloud computing. Some of the important favorable factors are discussed below. Entry cost for a business to set itself up in cloud is much less compared to traditional setup. Cost for running Information Technology (IT) business in cloud world can be visualized as operational cost. Organizations can use only applications which are suited for their need and not pay huge amounts on licenses for using a software suite.</em></p>
        <h1 style="color:black; text-align: center;"><b><em>Deployment models</em></b></h1>
        <h1 style="color:rgb(167, 184, 13); text-align: center;"><b><em>1.Private cloud</em></b></h1>
        <p style="color :rgb(245, 18, 158); font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources.</em></p>
        <h1 style="color:rgb(167, 184, 13); text-align: center;"><b><em>2.Public Cloud</em></b></h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(245, 18, 158) ; font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers. Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications</em></p>
        <h1 style="color:rgb(167, 184, 13); text-align: center;"><b><em>3.Hybrid Cloud</em></b></h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(245, 18, 158) ; font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services.</em></p>
        <p style="color:rgb(245, 18, 158) ; font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em></em></p>

        <h1 style="color:black; text-align: center;"><b><em>Limitations</em></b> </h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(63, 169, 240); font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Cloud computing is beneficial to many enterprises; it lowers costs and allows them to focus on competence instead of on matters of IT and infrastructure. Nevertheless, cloud computing has proven to have some limitations and disadvantages, especially for smaller business operations, particularly regarding security and downtime.</em></p>
        <h1 style="color:black; text-align: center;"><b><em>Emerging Trends<em></b></h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(204, 76, 17); font-size: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>Cloud computing is still a subject of research.A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been chief technology officers seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house.Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud Research and Development. For example, in 2011 Microsoft committed 90 percent of its $9.6 billion R&D budget to its cloud.Research by investment bank Centaur Partners in late 2015 forecasted that SaaS revenue would grow from $13.5 billion in 2011 to $32.8 billion in 2016</em></p>
